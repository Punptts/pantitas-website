Decoding UX/UI for the Login or Sign Up</h1>\n<p>This page is considered one of the most important pages. This is because it's commonly the page that users must go through to access the system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/decoding-login-signup-1.png\" alt=\"decoding-login-01\" title=\"decoding-login-01\"></p>\n<p>Generally, designing this page appears to be straightforward as it doesn't encompass complex components and the usage pattern is quite clear. However, behind the scenes there are multiple UX components involved, including designing input box states, text suggestions, and error cases, to name a few.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Most fitting terms...? 'Log In and Sign Up,' 'Sign In and Register,' or 'Create Account'</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing closely related words such as 'Sign Up' and 'Sign In' is not incorrect. However, similar terms can confuse users as they might not immediately understand what they're supposed to do. For this reason, more contrasting terms are commonly chosen, for example, 'Log In' and 'Sign Up' or 'Sign In' and 'Register'.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2. Streamlining Log In/Sign Up into a single page for fast and convenience access.</strong></p>\n<p>In designing the Log In and Sign Up pages, there should be links for users to seamlessly navigate between the two. It is recommended to design all steps within a single page so that users can decide whether to register or log in according to their needs. Additionally, only necessary information should be gathered to ensure the most efficient process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Designing the Input box for Log In / Sign Up to access the system requires considering effective communication.</strong></p>\n<p>The most crucial aspect to consider when designing the Input box is 'communication.' Clear communication aids users in taking action conveniently and swiftly. For instance, providing an option for users to toggle password visibility, using placeholders, and handling incorrect data entries effectively (error handling) are some considerations that help user get through the process faster and generate a better user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Users are lazy\" Generally, users prefer to minimize effort. Forgotten login details can hinder system access and negatively impact user experience.</strong></p>\n<p>There are numerous applications today that require users to log in to access their systems. Occasionally, users forget their account credentials and end up having to create a new one. Incorporating social media logins allows users to access the system using their existing FB, TW, Google, LinkedIn, or other social media accounts, greatly speeding up the registration process and reducing the risk of them forgetting their credentials.\"</p>\n<h2>Let's Get Prototype!</h2>\n<p>Click on Fullscreen icon on the top-right corner of the figma file to see the prototype.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FHqNPevRTxpi0ZDSIwuBoZ8%2FDecoding-10-Essential-UI-Design%3Fpage-id%3D1%253A13%26type%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D33-184%26viewport%3D171%252C408%252C0.09%26t%3DgKZkrsoYbWoPrJT6-1%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26starting-point-node-id%3D3%253A28%26mode%3Ddesign\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br><br/>\n<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlX6aICG-i0?si=DAks7TyzFNyyWwDU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"title":"Decoding 10 Essentials UX/UI Design to Master My Skills (Self Project)","cover":"/images/blogs/decoding-10-essentials-ui-design.png","date":"05/01/2024","description":"The aim of this project is to elevate my UI Design skills by delving deeply into and understanding the ten essential aspects of UI Design."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project/decoding-10-essentials-ux-iu-design"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
